# MachineLearning

This repository contains machine learning and AI-related experiments, tutorials, and utilities using Python. The project is organized into the following main folders:

## Project Structure

- **OpenAI/**: Scripts for interacting with the OpenAI API, including text generation, summarization, keyword extraction, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and creative chatbots.

- **PyTorch/**: Examples and experiments using the PyTorch deep learning framework.

- **Tutorials/**: Step-by-step tutorials and example scripts for NLP tasks using Hugging Face Transformers and PyTorch.

Each subfolder contains its own `README.md` with more details and requirements.

## Requirements

See the `README.md` in each subfolder for specific dependencies and setup instructions.
