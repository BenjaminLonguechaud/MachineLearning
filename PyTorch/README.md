# PyTorch

This folder contains Python scripts and experiments using the PyTorch deep learning framework.

## Contents

- `tensor.py`: Demonstrates basic tensor operations in PyTorch, including finding the index of maximum values in tensors along different dimensions.
- `sentimentanalysis.py`: Performs sentiment analysis on text using a pre-trained transformer model from Hugging Face's Transformers library and PyTorch.

## Requirements

To run the scripts in this folder, you need:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- The following Python packages:
  - `torch` (PyTorch)
  - `transformers` (for `sentimentanalysis.py`)

You can install the main dependencies with:

```bash
pip install torch transformers
```

Some scripts may require additional dependencies. See the top of each script or its docstring for details.
